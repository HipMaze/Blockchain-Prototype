# Blockchain-Prototype

##Description

This project serves multiple purposes. For one it is used primarly as a lab for my talks regarding blockchain and their use in cryptocurrencies. Secondly the different versions in this repository take a methodical and pedagogical approach to the subject so for anyone interested in learning the underlying mecanisms behind their favourite cryptocurrency this repository should be a helpful tool in doing just that.
